# Logistic-Regression

Skills Used: Python, Pandas, SKLearn, Seaborn, Logistic Regression

Project Objective: Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes

Quantifiable Results: Calculated Random forest,Adaboost Ensemble model,Bagging classifier model and Gradient Boost classifier model accuracy which was 1.0 in all the models

Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis
